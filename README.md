Fontstrap is a bootstrap plugin that lets you adjust your font size. There's literally nothing else with a few extra auxiliary functions.

<h2>How to use:</h2>
<p>size-#em, size-#rem, "scale"-up-#em, "scale"-up-#em for a flat adjustment of something to 1.5em for a "span" element you'd use class="size-150em" and same goes for rem units if you're using that</p>
<p>the scale-units have 2 parts, for example md-125em would make the font size only 1.25em when the screen fits the condition for md (see bootstrap) if you want the font size to be applied to all fonts and up like bootstrap use something like "md-up-125em"</p>
